# Tensorflow 3D Voxel Style Transfer
This projects attempts to perform style transfer on 3D models using 2D style images.

## Method 1
Performing style transfer on heightmaps of 2D terrains and rendering it in 3D.

## Method2
Performing style transfer on the 6 (top, bottom, left, right, front, back) projections of a voxel.

## Results
